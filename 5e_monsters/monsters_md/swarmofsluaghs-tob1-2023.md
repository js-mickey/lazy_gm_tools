### Special Abilities

- **Sunlight Weakness:** While in sunlight, the swarm of sluaghs has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
- **Swarm:** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny fey. The swarm can’t regain hp or gain temporary hp.

### Actions

- **Chilling Touch:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm’s space. Hit: 28 (8d6) cold damage, or 14 (4d6) cold damage if the swarm has half of its hp or fewer. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be unable to regain hp for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shadow Stealth:** While in dim light or darkness, the swarm of sluaghs takes the Hide action.
