- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the bat can't bite another target. The bat regains hp equal to the necrotic damage dealt.
