### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The kaveph makes two smash attacks.
- **Smash:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the kaveph.
- **Rock:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

### Reactions

- **Revenge:** When a kaveph is dealt 20 damage or more by a single attack and survives, it can make a smash attack against the attacker.
