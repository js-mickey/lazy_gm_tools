### Actions

- **Rapier:** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.

### Reactions

- **Parry:** If the noble is wielding a melee weapon and can see their attacker, they add 2 to their AC against one melee attack that would hit them.
- **Nobles were raised to wealth:** A noble is trained in swordsmanship, but their greatest defense is their entourage of armed protectors.
- **In non-feudal societies:** Nobles are primarily noncombatants: the knight or veteran stat block better represents an aristocrat with extensive military experience.
