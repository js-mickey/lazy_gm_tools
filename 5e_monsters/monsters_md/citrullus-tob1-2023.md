### Special Abilities

- **False Appearance:** While the citrullus remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal melon plant.
- **Gush:** When the citrullus takes bludgeoning damage, sticky juice splashes out of it. If the attacker is within 30 feet of the citrullus, the attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the sticky juice as if it had failed a saving throw against the plant’s Bile Spray action.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (4d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage.
- **Bile Spray (Recharge 5–6):** The citrullus exhales pink bile in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 14 (4d6) acid damage and is restrained by the sticky seed-filled juice for 1 minute. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t restrained. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check.

### Bonus Actions

- **Creeping Seedlings:** The seeds in the sticky juice grow viny tendrils and drag each creature restrained by Bile Spray and Gush up to 25 feet straight toward the citrullus.
