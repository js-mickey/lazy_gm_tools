### Special Abilities

- **Foul Odor:** Any creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the giant sloth must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on its next attack roll or ability check.
- **Hunter's Dash (1/Day):** The giant sloth moves double its normal speed and has advantage on all of its attacks for 1 round.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The giant sloth makes two attacks: one with its claw and one with its bite. If the giant sloth is grappling a creature, it can also use its Sloth's Embrace once.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 15) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the sloth doesn't have another creature grappled.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Sloth's Embrace:** The giant sloth crushes a creature it is grappling by pulling the creature against its fetid, furry chest. The target must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails the save is also stunned until the end of its next turn.
