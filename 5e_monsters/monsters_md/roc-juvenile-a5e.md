### Special Abilities

- **Keen Sight:** The roc has advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The roc attacks once with its beak and once with its talons  or makes a beak attack and drops a grappled creature or held object.
- **Beak:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit  reach 10 ft.  one target. Hit: 16 (3d6+6) piercing damage.
- **Talons:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one target. Hit: 16 (3d6+6) slashing damage  and the target is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends  the target is restrained  and the roc can't attack a different target with its talons.

### Reactions

- **Retributive Strike:** When a creature the roc can see hits it with a melee weapon attack, the roc makes a beak attack against its attacker.
